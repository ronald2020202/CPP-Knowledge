# CPP-Knowledge
Compilation of miscellaneous and also semi-related programs that encapsulate  my C++ competitive programming learning experience. The two big contests I prepare for are the Waterloo CCC contest and the USACO contests. 

Waterloo Past Contests are at this [link](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html). Scroll to the bottom for programming contests. Also, CCCGrader can be used for testing code.

USACO is [here](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests). Make an account to test code.
