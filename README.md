# CPP-Knowledge
Compilation of miscellaneous and also semi-related programs that encapsulate  my C++ competitive programming learning experience(2021-present). The two big contests I prepare for are the Waterloo CCC contest and the USACO contests. 

Waterloo Past Contests are at this [link](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html). Scroll to the bottom for programming contests. Also, CCCGrader can be used for testing code. Since approx. 2024, the past contests site has been updated, and you cannot download test data. Use the link & Internet Archive.

USACO is [here](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests). Make an account to test code.
